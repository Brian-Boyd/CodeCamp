 <h2>Let's face it...</h2>
 <p> Everybody daydreams about wrecking havoc every once in awhile. 
 StoryBreaks is here to capitalize on those daydreams by snagging scenarios you 
 imagine and throwing them out to aspiring writers also killing time during their day. 
 Here's how it works.</p>
 <ul>
  <li>If you already have alternate realities swirling in your head, send us your original scenario by skipping directly to 
  #5 below and recapping your vision in the box handily subtitled Pick me! Let my wandering mind and powers of procrastination amount 
  to something, finally!</li>
  <li>If this is one of those days where NOTHING is happening in that lump atop your neck,
   use our handy Chaos Creators to get the creative juices flowing.</li>
  <li>Give us your name and contact info. If we use your scenario as our Wacky Weekly 
  Writing Assignment, you'll win a $50 gift card to 
  <a href="http://www.theawesomer.com" target="_blank"> TheAwesomer.com,</a> and much free publicity
  on our website as we talk about your general greatness. You'll also probably be invited
  to be a guest judge of the stories submitted based on your winning scenario.</li>
 </ul>
 <p>Now get to it. Put down that memo, cast away all thoughts of that looming deadline, and
 dream up an alternate reality. Go!</p>
